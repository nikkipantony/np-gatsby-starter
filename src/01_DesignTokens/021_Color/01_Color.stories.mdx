# Color Design Tokens

Design tokens are design decisions, represented as data, that ensure systematically unified and 
cohesive product experiences. On this page you will find example color design tokens to be used 
within the design system. Extra rules, best practices and examples of how color should and 
should not be used can also be added to this page as the desgin system develops and these decions 
have been made to aid designers making future design decions for components within the system.

## Brand Color Tokens

These are example brand colors. Brand colors are a chosen color
palette used to represent a certain company. A consistent and
strategic application of brand colors can increase brand
awareness and recognizability as well as improved design
consistency and there for give a better user experience and help
build a greater trust in a company.

<div id="Action" style={{ marginTop: "80px", }}></div>

## Action Color Tokens

These are example action colors. Action colors are semantic
colors used to communicate to a user with a specific purpose.
For example, Green has a positive connotation so it is commonly
used as an action color to convey success.

## Gradient Tokens

These are example color gradients. Gradients can be used within
user interfaces when being built with design systems to give
more creative freedom to designers. While flat colors brings
consistency it can also sometimes stifle a design's potential,
gradients can open the door to infinite possibilities. Through
blending brand colors, designers can create eye-catching and
more memorable visual designs and brand identities.

<div id="Opacity" style={{ marginTop: "80px", }}></div>

## Opacity Tokens

These are example opacity values. In design opacity refers to
how transparent an object is. Objects with lower opacity allow
more light to pass through them, therefore becoming more
see-through. The more solid an object is, the less light that
can pass through it which translates to a higher opacity.

<div id="Shades" style={{ marginTop: "80px", }}></div>

## Shade Tokens

These are example shade values. Color shades are based on the
percentage of black within a color. It is a good idea to scale
color shade names between 0 and 100 in design systems. This
scale is based on HSL darkness for simplicity and it's also a
good ideas to offer just a limited number of shade options to
help with consistency, avoid endless decision making and assist
with accessibility compliance.

<div id="Tints" style={{ marginTop: "80px", }}></div>

## Tint Tokens

These are example tint values. Color tints are based on the
percentage of white within a color. It is a good idea to scale
color tint names between 0 and 100 in design systems. This scale
is based on HSL lightness for simplicity and it's also a good
ideas to offer just a limited number of shade options to help
with consistency, avoid endless decision making and assist with
accessibility compliance.
