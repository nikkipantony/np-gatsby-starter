# Typography Design Tokens
Typography is an important part of a design system that brings consistency across experiences and platforms. Good typography rules help present content clearly and efficiently as well as convey the overall brands style and tone.

<div style={{ maxWidth: "500px", boxShadow: "rgb(0 0 0 / 10%) 0 4px 6px 0", border: "2px solid rgba(0, 0, 13, 1)", borderRadius: "4px", padding: "30px", marginTop: "20px", }}>

## Contents

<nav>
<ul style={{ marginTop: "20px", paddingLeft: "20px" }}>
    <li><a href="#Typefaces">Typeface Tokens</a></li>
    <li><a href="#FontSizes">Font Size Tokens</a></li>
    <li><a href="#FontWeights">Font Weight Tokens</a></li>
    <li><a href="#Leading">Leading Tokens</a></li>
    <li><a href="#Tracking">Tracking Tokens</a></li>
</ul>
</nav>

<div id="Typefaces" style={{ marginTop: "80px", }}></div>

## Typeface Tokens

A typeface is a set of characters of the same design. 
These characters include letters, numbers, punctuation marks, 
and symbols.

<Typefaces />


<div id="FontSizes" style={{ marginTop: "80px", }}></div>

## Font Size Tokens

All font sizes in this design system have a ratio of 1.250, 
known as the Major Third type scale. This means that each size is 
multiplied or divided by 1.250 from the previous size, starting 
with the base size (1rem / 16px), and rounded. Custom text 
(any non-existing typography component) should use a font size 
from this list.

<FontSizes />


<div id="FontWeights" style={{ marginTop: "80px", }}></div>

## Font Weight Tokens

Typeface families come with a range of possible font weights
(boldness). These typically have a scale from 100 (Thin) through
to 700 (Bold) and then to 900 (known as Black). By specifying
specific font weights to be used within the design system we
help simplify the typography of the system and help create
better uniformity throughout the UI as a whole.

<FontWeights />


<div id="Leading" style={{ marginTop: "80px", }}></div>

## Leading Tokens

In Typography, leading is the space between adjacent lines of
type. In web development this is known as `line-height` and it
can be set using many different value types. In this design
system we use unit-less values where the number given is
multiplied by the element's font size.

<div id="Tracking" style={{ marginTop: "80px", }}></div>

## Tracking Tokens

Tracking is the horizontal spacing between type characters which
is set using the `letter-spacing` CSS property. Positive values
of `letter-spacing` cause characters to spread farther apart,
while negative values bring characters closer together. In this
design system we set the tracking value using the `em` unit as
this is relative to the font size of the text (e.g 2em means 2
times the size of the current font).
